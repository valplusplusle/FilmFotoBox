# FilmFotoBox
This project is a funny party game. You can build a whole Photobox system with touchscreen, DSLR-Camera and Printer. Or you Just play it on your phone or Laptop/Tablet.
At first you have to say how many people should be on the screen. After this a random picture of a famous movie scene appears on the screen. Now you have 30seconds time to copy the image. After that it will take a snapshot. After this you can print or share it.
At least dont forget to Smile:)
